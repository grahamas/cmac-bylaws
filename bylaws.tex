\item The name shall be changed by motion and second from the floor at the

% * Membership
\section{Membership} \label{membership}

% ** Definition
\subsection{Definition}

Members:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item have been recommended by the Conductor for Membership; and
  \item have been approved and invited by the Board; and
  \item have accepted the invitation of Membership.
\end{enumerate}
Members who are registered students of the University of Chicago have voting
privileges for meetings of the Membership and Annual Meetings, except where
otherwise specified.  In abiding by Office of the Reynolds Club and Student
Activities rules, Members who are not registered students of the University of
Chicago will have no voting privileges.

The Board shall decide whether or not to invite a Recommendee who is a student
of the University of Chicago by majority vote. In the case where the Recommendee
is not a student of the University of Chicago, the decision to invite shall only
be made by unanimous vote of the Board.

% ** Section
\subsection{Section}

The Conductor shall assign each Member to one of four sections which
correspond to the four musical voice parts for men's voices and to
any sub-sections or additional sections as necessary.

% ** Period of Membership and Dues
\subsection{Period of Membership and Dues}

Excepting resignation or removal from Membership pursuant hereto,
each Member shall retain their Membership for so long as the Member shall remain
a student at the University of Chicago (or, in the case of a non-student,
for one year following their entrance into Membership) and continue
to pay such dues as may be determined under these Bylaws.

% ** Alumni
After three consecutive quarters of membership (or two, if the member's first
quarter was Winter quarter), the member is eligible to become a CMAC Alum
(hereafter simply Alum). Everyone eligible to become a CMAC Alum will be invited
to join the CMAC Alumni Association upon graduation.

% ** Member Attendance
\subsection{Member Attendance} \label{attendance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Members shall make every attempt to attend all regular rehearsals,
  meetings, and performances (as defined in Section \ref{gig}).
\item Members who agree to perform in a gig shall
  make all attempts to attend it.
\item Members shall make every attempt to attend special rehearsals, sectionals,
  and meetings (as defined in Section \ref{meeting})
\item A Member who does not attend any rehearsal or performance shall be
  considered absent from that rehearsal or performance.
\item Arrival of a Member to a regular rehearsal or performance after the
  scheduled start time shall be considered a tardy. Two tardies shall equate to
  an absence.
\item Absence of a Member from a regular rehearsal or performance for twenty
  minutes or more shall be considered absent.
\item Prior to an absence or tardy, Members must notify the entire executive
  board of their upcoming absence/tardy via email, providing their reason.
\item Unless excused in advance by the Board, attendance at all Dress Rehearsals
  is mandatory for performance in a concert.
\item A Member who has accrued three absences during one regular academic
  quarter shall be required to have a meeting with the Officers within one week
  of the third absence for review. Officers shall review the Member's
  performance, attendance and prior notifications of absences and decide what
  action to take by a majority of the Board. Decisions shall be made attempting
  in all cases to preserve both the musical and ethical integrity of the group.
\item A member who has accrued three or more absences in one academic quarter
  shall be considered to have excessive absence and faces disciplinary action,
  potentially exclusion from an upcoming performance.
\item Under extenuating circumstances, the above clauses may be lifted on
  an individual basis by a majority vote of the Officers.
\end{enumerate}

% ** Probation
\subsection{Probation}

The Executive Officers of the group may vote by majority whether to
put a Member on probation if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Said Member is absent three or more times within a quarter; or
\item The Conductor recommends probation for said member; or
\item Said Member fails to attend performance.
\end{enumerate}
The limit and terms of said probation period shall be determined by
the Board and the Conductor but may include the prohibition
of said member from rehearsals, gigs, and/or performances. If the
member in question violates the terms of the probation period the
Board may then begin proceedings to remove said members from the group.

% ** Lapse of Membership
\subsection{Lapse of Membership}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Membership lapses when a Member takes an extended break from
  participation in CMAC. This Member may be said to be ``on break.''
\item Conditions for lapsing are:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The Member communicates to exec in writing that they wish to take a
    break, or that they plan to miss 6 consecutive rehearsals.
  \item Any Member who is absent from 6 consecutive rehearsals is automatically
    considered to be on a break.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Members on break forfeit all voting privileges during their break.
\item If the Member does not return to full participation (as determined by the
  Board) in the quarter following their first full quarter on break, then the
  Member automatically forfeits their Membership, but without forfeiting their
  ability to become an Alum. The Board may grant only a single quarter extension
  on a case-by-case basis.
\item The only exception to the preceding rule is in the case that a Member is
  gone from the University for a maximum of three academic quarters
  (e.g. studying abroad). In this case, the lapse may last for that single
  academic year, with no extension.
\item A Member may return from break to full membership in the first week of
  Fall or Winter quarter, without needing Board approval. A Member may only
  return from break otherwise with a unanimous vote of the full Board, and the
  Board having consulted with the Conductor. In the case where the Board forbids
  a Spring quarter return, the Board may grant a single quarter extension of
  lapse even when it would be otherwise disallowed by these rules.
\end{enumerate}

% ** Removal from Membership
\subsection{Removal from Membership}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Membership may be rescinded under the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Uncontrollable tardiness or absenteeism; or
\item Egregiously inappropriate behavior, whether within CMAC or within the
  larger community; or
\item Violation of terms of probation; or
\item Any other behavior which the Board finds to be sufficiently serious and
  detrimental to the group.
\end{enumerate}
\item The following procedure shall be followed regarding the removal of
members from CMAC:

\begin{enumerate}
\item At a Meeting of the Board, one Officer shall first state the reasons
for removal and then shall make a motion to recommend to the Members
that said member (the Accused) shall be removed. A second for the
motion is required.
\item The Board shall then vote on the motion for removal from membership.
A simple majority is required for passage of the motion.
\item If the motion passes, then the Board shall:

\begin{enumerate}
\item immediately inform the Accused in writing of the decision and of
the reasons for the said decision; and
\item at the next regularly scheduled rehearsal, call an emergency meeting
of the Members to discuss and to vote on the removal of the Accused
from membership.
\end{enumerate}
\item The following shall occur at the Emergency Meeting:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Board shall give their rationale for the recommendation to
remove the Accused from membership.
\item The Accused or the Accused's representative shall then give a defense
of the Accused and shall respond to the rationale given by the Officers.
\item Speaking times for the Board and for the Accused or their representative
shall be equal.
\item The President shall then open the floor to all members (including the
  Accused) who wish to discuss the recommendation to remove the Accused. Every
  member who wishes to speak shall be given the opportunity to do so. The
  President shall announce procedure for the following discussion, including at
  a minimum that none shall speak out of turn and that none shall speak but when
  the President gives them the floor. These rules shall be strictly enforced,
  and multiple violations or egregious violation shall result in expulsion from
  the discussion space and forfeiture of speaking rights within the discussion.
\item When no one else wishes to speak, the Accused shall leave the room
and a Member shall then move to remove the Accused from membership.
A second is required.
\item The Members shall then vote to remove the Accused from membership.
The motion carries if two thirds of those assembled support the motion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Any member removed by the proceedure described in this section is no
  longer eligible to be an Alum.
\end{enumerate}

Officer, who shall have all the privileges and responsibilities of the
to-be-absent Officer for the duration of said absence. Until such an election
may be carried out, the Treasurer shall serve as Acting President. An Officer
may opt to hold two positions in such a situation, or may opt to consider their
own Position vacant for the duration of the proposed absence, thus requiring the
subsequent application of this Section to their own Position. However, no
Officer shall have more than one vote. In the case that an Officer opts to hold
two positions (meaning there will only be four votes within the Board), a fifth
vote will be granted to a Member of the group as defined below in Section
\ref{temporary_voting}.
