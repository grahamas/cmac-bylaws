* TODO 3.5.9 Provide explicit guidelines for dealing with attendance issues: Preserve 1) the musical integrity and 2) the ethical integrity of the group. [Meaning, if someone's absences mean you know they won't be able to perform in the concert, you are obligated to preserve the musical integrity of the concert. However, even if someone is so good that they could miss half the rehearsals and still benefit the concert's music, if they're not acting with integrity and making every attempt to come to practice, then you are obligated to preserve the group's ethical integrity and prevent them from performing in the concert]
